## Overview

These are my own written down instructions and reccomendations to running vail and other Vr titles on Linux
As im in now way employed by AEXLAB to do this or have any incentive to provide proper support on this topic, this is just meant as a guide and is not a set in stone best way to run this game.
Also this will most likely not be updated unless i encounter issues on my personal machine running Linux VR or someone i know Annoyes me enough that i take action.
**HOWEVER** If you are running in to problems feel free to ask me **_IN THE DEDICATED CHANNEL_** For "Vail linux progress" in the [Official Vail Discord server](https://discord.gg/vailvr).
**_DONT EVEN DARE TO DM ME ABOUT THIS UNLESS I KNOW YOU FROM THERE_**
